# DEPT front-end development assignment

This project was created by Olivier Bleker for DEPT Agency. It was made using React 17 and SASS. This was my first time really working with React, so it was a great learning experience and challenge that i thoroughly enjoyed!

Thank you for taking the time to review this! I had a lot of fun putting it together.
